************************************TIMER SETUP CALCULATIONS*******************************************************
11.0592 MHz per Oscillation
11.0592 MHZ / 12 Oscillations per machine cycle = 921600 Hz for each machine cycle

Scale down:
0.01 s * 921600 Hz = 9216 ticks for every hundreth of a second
.217 seconds/.01 = 21.7 times

Thus, I set up the time to count to 9216 ticks before overflowing. After the ISR is run 22 times, then ~.217 seconds have passed, so I toggle the LED port pin P1.2
************************************ISR RUNTIME CALCULATIONS*******************************************************
Shortest Time: 
The shortest time is when the ISR does not have to reset the counter tracking the number of times the ISR has run.
There are two instructions that do not occur, CPL P1.2 and MOV R0,#0. Not running these instructions saves 2 cycles, which
gives the following time.

ISR Shortest Run Time
Machine Cycle Time: 1/11.0592 MHZ * 12 ocillations/cycle = 1.08506 microseconds per machine cycle
ISR Run Time      : 8 cycles * 1.08506 microseconds = 8.68 microseconds

Note that the time is basically between when the Port pin P1.1 is complimented to when it gets to the second compliment.

Longest Time:
As discussed earlier, the longest ISR runtime occurs when the ISR resets a counter tracking its executions. These instructions
introduces 2 more cycles.

ISR Longest Run Time
Machine Cycle Time: 1/11.0592 MHZ 12 ocillations/cycle = 1.08506 microseconds per machine cycles
ISR Run Time      : 10 cycles * 1.08506 microseconds = 10.85 microseconds

The time measured at the unused port pin P1.1 was: 10.7 microseconds (screen capture is in this folder). This time is very close to the longest possible time, thus, this time measurement likely occured when the ISR was doing a reset.
There is only a 0.15 microsecond difference and it is hard to say what this is attributed to. It could be from the clock moving at a higher frequency than anticipated. It could be my cursor measurement
was slightly off. It is likely from noise in measuring, however, it is very close.
